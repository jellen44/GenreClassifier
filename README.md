# Genre Classification Algorithm
Interactive shiny app using the algorithm can be found at: https://jellen.shinyapps.io/LyricsAppJE/
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics

This project attempts to answer one specific question: is there a connection between the lyrics of a song and its genre? In other words, are there words that are more indicative of a specific genre than others? I used a dataset from Kaggle containing over 380,000 songs from MetroLyrics, with each songâ€™s title, genre, year and lyrical content. This dataset was made publicly available in 2016, and contains songs from date 1967 until 2016. For the purposes of this project, I used a subsetted version of the dataset of 25,000 songs, with 5,000 from each of five genres (Hip-Hop, Pop, Rock, Jazz and R&B). The lyrics of each song were transformed into one large document-feature matrix using the 'quanteda' package. This matrix was subsequently used as the input for the machine learning model. I used a support vector machine model, which is a commonly used supervised machine learning classification algorithm. The predictions of the SVM model on my testing dataset are in the 'predictionswrite.csv' file of the repository.
